public class SpreadsheetWriter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String extractedText = extractTextFromImage(); // call the function that extract the text
        XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook();
        XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.createSheet("Text");
        XSSFRow row = sheet.createRow(0);
        XSSFCell cell = row.createCell(0);
        cell.setCellValue(extractedText);
        try {
            FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("text.xlsx");
            workbook.write(outputStream);
            workbook.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
This code creates a new workbook and sheet, then creates a new row and cell, and sets the value of the cell to the extracted text. Finally, it writes the workbook to a file called "text.xlsx".

You can use other libraries like JExcel, JXL, etc. It depends on the requirements and your preferred library.

Please keep in mind that, the format of the spreadsheet (xls, xlsx, csv, etc) also depends on the requirements and the data size.
